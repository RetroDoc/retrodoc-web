# retrodoc-web
**== UNDER CONSTRUCTION ==**

Basically a website for documenting a bunch of stuff relating retrocomputing. Includes 9x/DOS-era stuff, fun hardware tinkering, and more. Made with compatibility on older browsers in mind.

Check it out here: https://retrodoc.github.io/retrodoc-web/

NOTE: This requires a web browser with HTTPS support (TLS 1.3). Browsers such as Retrozilla should work just fine; however, those that do not (e.g. Older versions of Internet Explorer) will not be able to display the page at all without the use of a proxy.
