# retrodoc-web
Basically a website for documenting a bunch of stuff relating retrocomputing. Includes 9x/DOS-era stuff, fun hardware tinkering, and more. Made with compatibility on older browsers in mind.

NOTE: This requires a web browser with HTTPS support (TLS 1.3). Browsers such as Internet Explorer, unfortunately, will not work; however, Retrozilla and other TLS-supported browsers should work just fine.
