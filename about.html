            <h4>The home of beginner-friendly & enthusiast-level retrocomputing</h4>

        <div id="about-desc">
            <p>RetroDoc is a website made by TYX8926, a retrocomputing enthusiast ironically, has never actually owned any computer or console old enough to be considered retro until very recently (excluding Windows XP). Many of these experiences are new, despite the long-lasting interest in the fields of retrocomputing.</p>
            <p>I primarily write writeups and documentations about retrocomputing-related content specifically on this website. The most particular in this instance would be the upcoming pages relating eras when Windows 9x and MS-DOS were prevalent in general and enthusiast-level home computing.</p>
            <p>The goal of this website is to bring not only general but obscure findings related to retrocomputing on the spotlight and create a simultaneous beginner-friendly and enthusiast-level documentation or writeup of it. Many questions I ask to myself throughout certain projects, such as building my first Windows 98 PC, have solutions and descriptions all over forums and other places, but they are never documented in a unified place, sometimes making them incredibly difficult to find. This site aims to mitigate such fragmented findings.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I hope this website still encourages the use of searching rather than total reliance. In many of the documentations (That will come about in the future), I will be referencing many websites that brought me to a certain conclusion or solution, and will present their point in case and how I used it on my end.</p>
            <p>Cheers!</p>
