        <h1>Quest to build my first Windows 98 PC</h1>
        <p><strong>Let's begin with a breakdown of something that needs to be said before we begin:</strong> I've never touched any tech older than the 2000s until I stumbled upon virtual machines. Neither have I had the chance, ever, to fully experience any of those old tech the way it was meant to be, because the time when I lived through my childhood was simply too new for such a thing to even coexist. The oldest operating system I've ever used with proper period-correct equipment was Windows XP, since the state of many computers around where I lived at the time was either Windows 7 or XP and they coexisted for years. This was true even years after Microsoft officially ended support for general-purpose editions of the OS.</p>
        <p>I'm a student who is nearing the college years of my life now, and I'm also a tech enthusiast who's interested in lots of old tech and software. When I first discovered all the older versions of Windows, down to the 9x and the early 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x days, and its rather big difference to my then-main Windows 7 laptop, at least in terms of how it looked and how it performed certain tasks, I was really mesmerized by what was made in the past. It did not seem real to me that this was what Windows looked like back then, but it also dawned on me just how the modernization of the internet looked like today compared to then. The operating system that remained in my mind the most, though, was Windows 98, and from time to time I'd see this operating system being showcased all over the place, arguably even more than Windows 95 did. And today, lots of retrocomputing enthusiasts tend to run this OS for a hybrid of DOS gaming and PC gaming from the 90s to the early 2000s, but they also tend to relive the past by completing one task I always thought was difficult: Building a period-correct PC.</p>
        <p>Since then, the biggest quest that I've been thinking about for years on end was to build some kind of physical hardware that would be capable of running an operating system from the 1990s. More specifically, I wanted to run Windows 98 on real hardware, with no unsupported hardware, and bring out equipment from that time period in question to live through something I wasn't even able to experience because I didn't even exist back then.</p>
